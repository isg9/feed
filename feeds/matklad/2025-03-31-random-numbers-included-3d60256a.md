# Random Numbers Included

Mar 31, 2025

I’ve recently worked on a [PRNG API for TigerBeetle](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2798), and made a surprising discovery! While most APIs work best with “half-open” intervals, `for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)`, it seems that random numbers really work best with closed intervals, `≤n`.

*First*, closed interval means that you can actually generate the highest-possible number:

```
prng.range_inclusive(
    u32,
    math.intMax(u32) - 9,
    math.intMax(u32),
);
```

This call generates one of the ten largest `u32` s. With exclusive ranges, you’d have to generate `u64` and downcast it.

*Second*, close interval removes a possibility of a subtle crash. It is impossible to generate a random number *less* than zero, so exclusive APIs are panicky. This can crash!: `rng.random_range(..n)`

*Third*, as a flip-side of the previous bullet point, by pushing the `-1` to the call-site, you make it immediately obvious that there’s non-zero pre-condition:

```
const replica = prng.int_inclusive(u8, replica_count - 1);
```
