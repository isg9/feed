# Illuminating synchronization edges for ThreadSanitizer

## [Illuminating synchronization edges for ThreadSanitizer](/blog/2022/10/03/)

[Sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki) are powerful development tools which complement [debuggers](/blog/2022/06/26/) and [fuzzing](/blog/2019/01/25/). I typically have at least one sanitizer active during development. They’re particularly useful during code review, where they can identify issues before I’ve even begun examining the code carefully — sometimes in mere minutes under fuzzing. Accordingly, it’s a good idea to have your own code in good agreement with sanitizers before review. For ThreadSanitizer (TSan), that means dealing with false positives in programs relying on synchronization invisible to TSan.

This article’s motivation is multi-threaded [epoll](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html). I mitigate TSan false positives each time it comes up, enough to have gotten the hang of it, so I ought to document it. [On Windows](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit) I would also run into the same issue with the Win32 message queue, crossing the synchronization edge between [PostMessage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-postmessagea) (release) and [GetMessage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getmessage) (acquire), *except* for the general lack of TSan support in Windows tooling. The same technique would work there as well.

My typical epoll scenario looks like so:

1. Create an epoll file descriptor ( `epoll_create1`).
2. Create worker threads, passing the epoll file descriptor.
3. Worker threads loop on `epoll_wait`.
4. Main thread loops on `accept`, adding sockets to epoll ( `epoll_ctl`).

Between `accept` and `EPOLL_CTL_ADD`, the main thread allocates and initializes the client session state, then attaches it to the epoll event. The client socket is added with [the `EPOLLONESHOT` flag](https://idea.popcount.org/2017-02-20-epoll-is-fundamentally-broken-12/), and the session state is not touched after the call to `epoll_ctl` (note: sans error checks):

```
for (;;) {
    int fd = accept(...);
    struct session *session = ...;
    session->fd = fd;
    // ...
    struct epoll_event;
    event.events = EPOLLET | EPOLLONESHOT | ...;
    event.events.data.ptr = session;
    epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, fd, &event);
}

```

In this example, `struct session` is defined by the application to contain all the state for handling a session (file descriptor, buffers, [state
machine](/blog/2020/12/31/), parser state, [allocation arena](https://www.rfleury.com/p/untangling-lifetimes-the-arena-allocator), etc.). Everything else is part of the epoll interface.

When a socket is ready, one of the worker threads receive it. Due to `EPOLLONESHOT`, it’s immediately disabled and no other thread can receive it. The thread does as much work as possible (i.e. read/write until `EAGAIN`), then reactivates it with `epoll_ctl`:

```
for (;;) {
    struct epoll_event event;
    epoll_wait(epfd, &event, 1, -1);
    struct session *session = event.data.ptr;
    int fd = session->fd;
    // ...
    event.events = EPOLLET | EPOLLONESHOT | ...;
    epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, fd, &event);
}

```

The shared variables in `session` are passed between threads through `epoll` using the event’s `.user.ptr`. These variables are potentially read and mutated by every thread, but it’s all perfectly safe without any further synchronization — i.e. no need for mutexes, etc. All the necessary synchronization is implicit in epoll.

In the initial hand-off, that `EPOLL_CTL_ADD` must *happen before* the corresponding `epoll_wait` in a worker thread. This establishes that the main thread and worker thread do not touch session variables concurrently. After all, how could the worker see an event on the file descriptor before it’s been added to epoll? The synchronization in epoll itself will also ensure all the architecture-level stores are visible to other threads before the hand-off. We can call the “add” a *release* and the “wait” an *acquire*, forming a synchronization edge.

Similarly, in the hand-off between worker threads, the `EPOLL_CTL_MOD` that reactivates the file descriptor must *happen before* the wait that observes the next event because, until reactivation, it’s disabled. The `EPOLL_CTL_MOD` is another *release* in relation to the *acquire* wait.

Unfortunately TSan won’t see things this way. It can’t see into the kernel, and it doesn’t know these subtle epoll semantics, so it can’t see these synchronization edges. As far [as it can tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5erqWdlhQLA), threads might be accessing a session concurrently, and TSan will reliably produce warnings about it. You could shrug your shoulders and give up on using TSan in this case, but there’s an easy solution: introduce redundant, semantically identical synchronization edges, but only when TSan is looking.

```
WARNING: ThreadSanitizer: data race

```

### Redundant synchronization

I prefer to solve this by introducing the weakest possible synchronization so that I’m not synchronizing beyond epoll’s semantics. This will help TSan catch real mistakes that stronger synchronization might hide.

The weakest option is memory fences. These wouldn’t introduce extra loads or stores. At most it would be a fence instruction. I would use [GCC’s
built-in `__atomic_thread_fence`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-12.2.0/gcc/_005f_005fatomic-Builtins.html) for the job. However, TSan does not currently understand thread fences, so that defeats the purpose. Instead, I introduce a new field to `struct session`:

```
struct session {
    int fd;
    // ...
    int _sync;
};

```

Then just before `epoll_ctl` I’ll do a *release* store on this field, “releasing” the session. All session stores are ordered before the release.

```
    // main thread
    // ...
    __atomic_store_n(&session->_sync, 0, __ATOMIC_RELEASE)
    epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, fd, &event);

    // worker thread
    // ...
    __atomic_store_n(&session->_sync, 0, __ATOMIC_RELEASE)
    epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, fd, &event);

```

After `epoll_wait` I add an *acquire* load, “acquiring” the session. All session loads are ordered after the acquire.

```
    epoll_wait(epfd, &event, 1, -1);
    struct session *session = event.data.ptr;
    __atomic_load_n(&session->_sync, __ATOMIC_ACQUIRE)
    int fd = session->fd;
    // ...

```

For this to work, the thread must not touch session variables in any way before the acquire or after the release. For example, note how I obtained the client file descriptor before the release, i.e. no `session->fd` argument in the `epoll_ctl` call.

That’s it! This redundantly establishes the *happens before* relationship already implicit in epoll, but now it’s visible to TSan. However, I don’t want to pay for this unless I’m actually running under TSan, so some macros are in order. `__SANITIZE_THREAD__` is automatically defined when running under TSan:

```
#if __SANITIZE_THREAD__
# define TSAN_SYNCED     int _sync
# define TSAN_ACQUIRE(s) __atomic_load_n(&(s)->_sync, __ATOMIC_ACQUIRE)
# define TSAN_RELEASE(s) __atomic_store_n(&(s)->_sync, 0, __ATOMIC_RELEASE)
#else
# define TSAN_SYNCED
# define TSAN_ACQUIRE(s)
# define TSAN_RELEASE(s)
#endif

```

This also makes it more readable, and intentions clearer:

```
struct session {
    int fd;
    // ...
    TSAN_SYNCED;
};

    // main thread
    for (;;) {
        // ...
        TSAN_RELEASE(session);
        epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, fd, &event);
    }

    // worker thread
    for (;;) {
        epoll_wait(epfd, &event, 1, -1);
        struct session *session = event.data.ptr;
        TSAN_ACQUIRE(session);
        int fd = session->fd;
        // ...
        TSAN_RELEASE(session);
        epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, fd, &event);
    }

```

Now I can use TSan again, and it didn’t cost anything in normal builds.
